# david-hasslehoff-wallpaper-payload

This is a simple harmless payload that changes a users' wallpaper to a picture of David Hasslehoff explaining the dangers of leaving your machine unlocked.
Unlike lots of scripts I've seen that struggle with how to set the wallpaper using different browsers, this simply uses mspaint and so doesn't even need to download the file seperately - you just open the URL in paint!
